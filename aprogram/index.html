<h3>Intelligent Systems for Smart Cities</h3>	
The concept of Smart Cities can be understood as a holistic approach to improve the level of development and management of the city in a broad range of services by using information and communication technologies. It is common to recognize six axes of work in them: i) Smart Economy, ii) Smart People, iii) Smart Governance, iv) Smart Mobility, v) Smart Environment, and vi) Smart Living. In this talk we first focus on a capital issue: smart mobility. European citizens and economic actors need a transport system which provides them with seamless, high-quality door-to-door mobility. At the same time, the adverse effects of transport on the climate, the environment and human health need to be reduced. We will show many new systems based in the use of bio-inspired techniques to ease the road traffic flow in the city, as well as allowing a customized smooth experience for travelers (private and public transport). This talk will then discuss on potential applications of intelligent systems for energy (like adaptive lighting in streets), environmental applications (like mobile sensors for air pollution), smart building (intelligent design), and several other applications linked to smart living, tourism, and smart municipal governance.

<h3>Prof. Enrique Alba, University of M&aacute;laga (Spain)</h3>
Prof. Enrique Alba had his degree in engineering and PhD in Computer Science in 1992 and 1999, respectively, by the University of M&aacute;laga (Spain). He works as a Full Professor in this university with varied teaching duties: data communications, distributed programing, software quality, and also evolutionary algorithms, bases for R+D+i and smart cities, both at graduate and master/doctoral programs. Prof. Alba leads an international team of researchers in the field of complex optimization/learning with applications in smart cities, bioinformatics, software engineering, telecoms, and others. In addition to the organization of international events (ACM GECCO, IEEE IPDPS-NIDISC, IEEE MSWiM, IEEE DS-RT, smart-CT, ...) Prof. Alba has offered dozens postgraduate courses, more than 70 seminars in international institutions, and has directed many research projects (7 with national funds, 5 in Europe, and numerous bilateral actions). Also, Prof. Alba has directed 12 projects for innovation in companies (OPTIMI, Tartessos, ACERINOX, ARELANCE, TUO, INDRA, AOP, VATIA, EMERGIA, SECMOTIC, ArcelorMittal, ACTECO, CETEM, EUROSOTERRADOS) and has worked as invited professor at INRIA, Luxembourg, Ostrava, Japan, Argentina, Cuba, Uruguay, and Mexico. He is editor in several international journals and book series of Springer-Verlag and Wiley, as well as he often reviews articles for more than 30 impact journals. He is included in the list of most prolific DBLP authors, and has published 107 articles in journals indexed by ISI, 11 books, and hundreds of communications to scientific conferences. He is included in the top ten most relevant researchers in Informatics in Spain (ISI), and is the most influent researcher of UMA in engineering (webometrics), with 13 awards to his professional activities. Pr. Alba's H index is 55, with more than 14,700 cites to his work.

<h3> Toward Robust and Intelligent IoT Systems using Adaptive Control and Runtime Models </h3>
The engineering of high-confidence IoT systems is neither an extension of traditional engineering nor a straightforward application of software engineering, but rather a new systems-engineering science. There are many challenges that must be addressed to harvest the rich economic opportunities of these systems. First and foremost, creating and maintaining a skilled workforce to support the design, engineering, deployment, and operation of future IoT systems is a significant challenge for industry, academia and governments. Engineers, scientists and developers not only need strong backgrounds in IoT foundations, but also significant knowledge in relevant application domains. In this talk, we discuss how adaptive control and models at runtime are key enablers toward robust and intelligent IoT systems.

<h3> Hausi A. Müller, Department of Computer Science Faculty of Engineering, University of Victoria, Canada </h3>
Dr. Müller is a Computer Science Professor and Associate Dean of Research in the Faculty of Engineering at University of Victoria. He is Co-Chair of IEEE Future Directions Quantum Initiative and Member 2019 IEEE Conferences Committee. He was the 2016-2018 Vice President IEEE CS Technical and Conference Activities (T and C) Board and 2011-2015 Chair IEEE CS Technical Council on Software Engineering (TCSE). His research interests include software engineering, adaptive systems, intelligent cyber physical systems, Internet of Things, context-aware systems, quantum computing and quantum information science. He is co-founder of the SEAMS conference series—ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems.
