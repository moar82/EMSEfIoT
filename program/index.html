<h2>Dinner after the event  </h2>
We are organizing a dinner the night of the workshop. The dinner is optional, and everybody pay their own bill.  The idea is to have the opportunity to discuss with our keynote speakers, committee and people involved.  For that purpose we need to know in advance how many people will participate, so we ask you to complete the survey at most 
this <b>Saturday 11th of May</b>.
