<h3>COVID-19 message from ICSE organizers</h3> 
<p>The ICSE 2020 conference has gone virtual due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, we would like to remind you that ICSE 2021 is scheduled to be held in Madrid from May 23 to 29, 2021. As there are chances that the world will be dealing with different confinement and mobility restrictions when ICSE 2021 is due to be held, we would like you to know that we are preparing for different potential scenarios:

    If travel is not possible for some regions, we will be flexible and allow virtual presentations for affected speakers;
    If travel is possible but some of you prefer not to make the journey, we will be flexible and allow virtual presentations for speakers preferring to stay at home;
    If the situation is very much as it is today, ICSE 2021 will go virtual.

We want to reassure everyone that any paper accepted at ICSE 2021 will be published in the proceedings. We will also guarantee valuable interaction on the papers to be presented, as well as effective networking opportunities either in face-to-face or virtual formats or through a mixture of both, depending on needs. There is, therefore, nothing to stop you from submitting to ICSE 2021.

We would also like to emphasize that all submission dates are firm. We acknowledge that COVID-19 brings in substantial extra work, stress, and difficulty, for many of us. To ensure sufficient time is available for a high quality reviewing process in these difficult circumstances, we will not postpone the submission dates.

Our top priority is the safety and well-being of all ICSE 2021 participants. We look forward to meeting you all for ICSE 2021. For further information see <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICSE conference page</a></p>
