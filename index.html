				<p>We face a new software crisis. 
			        In 1968, computer scientists learned that developing robust software requires skills, methods, and tools. Today, software and hardware engineers realize that developing a robust Internet of Things (IoT) also pushes the states of their art and practice. Recent news illustrate the many problems faced by IoT: from lack of inter-operability to broken updates to massive security attacks. In this context, the First International Workshop on Software Engineering Research & Practices for Internet of Things (SERP4IoT 2019) aims to provide a highly interactive forum for researchers and practitioners to address the challenges of, find solutions for, and share experiences with the development, release, and testing of robust software for IoT devices. </p>
